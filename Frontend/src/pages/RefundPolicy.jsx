REFUND POLICY

We offer a 7 days "NO QUESTIONS ASKED" refund Policy.
Within the 7 days of your course purchase, you can ask for the refund anytime.
For refunds, please please mail us at support@namastedev.com
In case of course bundle, a refund will be initiated for the whole course bundle, and not for individual courses.
After the refund is initiated, it takes around 5-7 business days for the amount to be reflected in your bank.
Please note that once a refund is processed, no further refunds will be provided for the same purchase/course.
Purchases made using the "Gift-a-course" feature are not eligible for a refund.
Refunds are only provided if you have access to the course.
If your email ID is found to be suspicious or involved in malicious activity, a refund will not be initiated.
If any queries, feel free to contact us at support@namastedev.com
